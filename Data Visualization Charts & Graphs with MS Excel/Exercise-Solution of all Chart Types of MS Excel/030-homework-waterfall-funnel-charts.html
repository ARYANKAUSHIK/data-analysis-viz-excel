<p><strong>2)</strong> You just posted a job opening, and a total of <strong>100</strong> people applied. Of the 100 applicants, you invited <strong>45</strong> to interview. <strong>15</strong> declined, but among those who interviewed <strong>50%</strong> were invited to a second round. <strong>5</strong> people from round two were invited to a final interview, and only <strong>1</strong> was eventually offered the job.</p>



<p>Create a <strong>Funnel Chart</strong> to visualize the number of people who progressed through each of the stages above (initial applicants, first interview, second interview, final interview, etc).</p>
